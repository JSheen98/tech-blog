# Tech Blog

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description:

With this project, I wanted to create a website that a user could create and view tech blogs on. This website features sign up, and login to ensure a secure session while browsing and creating blogs. The user can also add comments to other peoples blog posts to voice their opinion on it. The user also has the option to view blog posts while signed out, however, they won't be able to comment, or create/edit/delete their own posts. They will need to be signed up and logged in to have that functionality.
